The goal of this project is to program the [Udacity Carla vehicle](docu_images/190303_StAn_Udacity_Carla_01.jpg) so it can detect and respect traffic lights in real time when driving in a simulator environment and a real environment.

The Udacity Carla vehicle provides a [ROS](http://www.ROS.org/) interface and uses the [ADAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_systems) kit [dbw_mkz_ros](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros) from [Dataspeed Inc](https://www.dataspeedinc.com/).

The connection of the different ROS nodes follows the descriptions provided in the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) (2 term course). The basic logic of the traffic light classification uses [Convolutional Neutral Networks (CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) and follows [Mathias Köhnke's solution](https://github.com/mkoehnke/CarND-Capstone). A high level overview of [TensorFlow’s Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) is provided by [Daniel Stang](https://medium.com/@WuStangDan/step-by-step-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial-part-1-selecting-a-model-a02b6aabe39e). Additional traffic light images were gathered from [LISA](https://www.kaggle.com/mbornoe/lisa-traffic-light-dataset) and [Bosch Small Traffic Light Dataset](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/6132/).

The following table shows an overview of the most important files:

## 1. Tool chain setup

### 1. Considerations for the best simulation and test environment

The following hardware and software was available during the development.

| Description |
|-------------|
| Intel i7-8700K Coffee Lake (6-Core, 12-Thread, 3.7 GHz, 12MB Cache, 95W, CPU Benchmark 16822) |
| Asus ROG Strix Z370G |
| 64GB Corsair DDR4 3000 CL15 |
| Gigabyte Quiet GTX 1060 6GB - 1280 CUDA Cores |
| 2x Samsung 960 EVO 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 3 x 4 SSD (3200/1900 MBps R/W) |
| 20TB Synology NAS with 2x 1 GB/s Ethernet |
| Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 dual boot |
| VMware Workstation 15 Pro (with own Ubuntu virtual machine) |
| VirtualBox 6.0 (with Udacity provided Lubuntu virtual machine) |
| Udacity Workspace |

This project requires a host for the Udacity Simulator and a host for the Udacity Carla ROS environment. The following options have been tested in conjunction with each other.

| Number | Udacity Simulator | Findings |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | Udacity Workspace VNC | Runs slow when camera sends images |
| 2 | Windows with GPU | Runs slow when camera sends images to virtualized ROS environment |
| 3 | Windows / VMware | Runs very slow when camera sends images |
| 4 | Windows / VirtualBox | Runs extremely slow when camera sends images |
| 5 | Ubuntu w/o GPU | Runs slow when camera sends images |
| 6 | Ubuntu with GPU | Runs perfect |

| Udacity Carla ROS environment | Combinations | Findings |
|-------------------------------|--------------|----------|
| Udacity Workspace Terminal | 1 | Some effort to install all packages correctly. Runs too slow due to Udacity Simulator in Udacity Workspace VNC. |
| Windows / VMware | 2, 3 | Very difficult to install all packages correctly. Runs too slow due to slow simulator options. |
| Windows / VMware / Docker | 2, 3 | Some effort to install all packages correctly. Runs too slow due to slow simulator options. |
| Windows / VirtualBox | 2, 4 | Difficult to install all packages correctly. Runs too slow due to slow simulator options. |
| Windows / VirtualBox / Docker | 2, 4 | Some effort to install all packages correctly. Runs too slow due to slow simulator options. |
| Ubuntu with CPU | 5, 6 | Very difficult to install all packages correctly. Runs too slow with option 5 and runs perfect with option 6. |
| Ubuntu with CPU / Docker | 5, 6 | Was not tested as it wasn't needed. |
| Ubuntu with CUDA | 5, 6 | Could not test due to incompatibility of Ubuntu 16.04 with CUDA 8.0 and NVIDIA GTX 1060. |
| Ubuntu with CUDA / Docker | 5, 6 | Could not test due to incompatibility of Ubuntu 16.04 with CUDA 8.0 and NVIDIA GTX 1060. |

The above evaluations led to the only viable solution of running everything native on a dual boot Ubuntu installation - using Ubuntu with GPU for the Udacity Simulator and Ubuntu with CPU for the Udacity Carla ROS environment. This setup is also very close to the actual setup in the Udacity Carla vehicle.

### 2. Ubuntu, ROS and necessary packages

To follow this project exactly you first need to install [Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Next you have to install [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu).

```console
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-desktop-full
sudo ROSdep init
ROSdep update
echo "source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
sudo apt install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
```

Then you need to install the Dataspeed ADAS drive-by-wire kit [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default).

```console
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ros-kinetic-dbw-mkz-msgs
<make sure you are in the ros subdirectory of this repository>
ROSdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --ROSdistro=kinetic -y
```

After downloading this repository you need to make sure that you have all the necessary packages installed.

```console
git pull https://github.com/CyberAMS/CarND-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install python-termcolor
```

### 3. Udacity Simulator

Finally, you need to download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

## 2. ROS nodes and topics

### 1. Communication overview

The Udacity Carla ROS environment for this project uses the following nodes and topics.

![alt text][image1]

The `/waypoint_loader` reads the map or trajectory information and publishes a list of waypoints that the vehicle can follow safely. The `/tl_detector` node takes this information and the camera image from the vehicle - either simulation or real - and publishes the state of the traffic light ahead (`GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `RED` or `UNKNOWN`). The above diagram shows the case for the simulated environment in which the `/styx_server` node publishes all the relevant vehicle state and sensor information as well as receives the necessary control signals for steering (not shown), throttle (not shown) and braking. The `/waypoint_updater` node determines the desired speed for the waypoints ahead. The `/pure_pursuit` node calculates the drive-by-wire commands for the `dbw_node` node based on the information about the waypoints ahead.

### 2. ROS node waypoint_updater.py

The `/waypoint_updater` node constantly looks for the next `LOOKAHEAD_WPS` waypoints. If the next traffic light is either `GREEN` or `UNKNOWN` (`self.stopline_wp_idx == -1`), it will not change the desired speed at the waypoints ahead. If the next traffic light is either `RED` or `YELLOW`, it will use decelerating speed for the waypoints ahead. It is important to mention that the vehicle might detect a `RED` or `YELLOW` traffic light, but will only react to it if the stop line of this traffic light is within distance of the next `LOOKAHEAD_WPS` waypoints.

```python
def generate_lane(self):
	lane = Lane()
	closest_idx = self.get_closest_waypoint_id()
	farthest_idx = closest_idx + LOOKAHEAD_WPS
	base_waypoints = self.base_lane.waypoints[closest_idx:farthest_idx]
	if (self.stopline_wp_idx == -1) or (self.stopline_wp_idx >= farthest_idx):
		lane.waypoints = base_waypoints
	else:
		lane.waypoints = self.decelerate_waypoints(base_waypoints, closest_idx)
	return lane
```

The decelerated speed is calculated as a minimum of the desired speed at the waypoints ahead and a square root function with a given `MAX_DECEL` deceleration that starts backwards with zero speed at the stop line of the traffic light ahead.

```python
def decelerate_waypoints(self, waypoints, closest_idx):
	temp = []
	for i, wp in enumerate(waypoints):
		p = Waypoint()
		p.pose = wp.pose
		stop_idx = max(self.stopline_wp_idx - closest_idx - 2, 0) # the waypoints are meassured from center so substract 2 to have the front of the car stop at the light
		dist = self.distance(waypoints, i, stop_idx)
		vel = math.sqrt(2 * MAX_DECEL * dist)
		if vel < 1.0:
			vel = 0.0
		p.twist.twist.linear.x = min(vel, wp.twist.twist.linear.x)
		temp.append(p)
	return temp
```

### 3. ROS node twist_controller.py

The `/twist_controller.py` node uses a yaw controller and throttle controller to determine steering, throttle and braking to keep the desired direction and speed. If the speed gets close to zero, the throttle is set to zero and the brake is engaged to hold the vehicle in place.

### 4. ROS node tl_detector.py

The `/tl_detector' node constantly determines whether or not an incoming image needs to be processed. Only every `LIGHT_PROCESS_THRESHOLD`-th image will be processed. The detected traffic light state is only valid if it has been detected `STATE_COUNT_THRESHOLD` times in a row. The function either returns the waypoint index of the stop line when the traffic light is `RED` or `YELLOW` or it returns `-1` if no traffic light stop state has been detected.

```python
def image_cb(self, msg):
	self.camera_image = msg
	if ((self.traffic_count % LIGHT_PROCESS_THRESHOLD) == 0):
		# traffic light must be processed
		light_wp, state = self.process_traffic_lights()
	else:
		light_wp = self.last_wp # use previous value
		state = self.last_state # use previous value
	self.traffic_count += 1
	if (self.state != state):
		self.state_count = 0
		self.state = state
	if (self.state_count >= STATE_COUNT_THRESHOLD):
		self.last_state = self.state
		light_wp = light_wp if ((state == TrafficLight.RED) or (state == TrafficLight.YELLOW)) else -1
		self.last_wp = light_wp
		self.upcoming_red_light_pub.publish(Int32(light_wp))
	else:
		self.upcoming_red_light_pub.publish(Int32(self.last_wp))
	self.state_count += 1
```

The following code is used to display debugging information about the actually correct and the detected traffic light states. It works very well if `python-termcolor` has been installed as mentioned in the above section.

```python
if bDEBUG:
	ROSpy.logwarn("----------------------------------------------------------------------")
classified_state = self.get_light_state(closest_light)
if bDEBUG:
	correct_state_str = self.state_to_string("Correct light state    ", closest_light.state)
	detected_state_str = self.state_to_string("Detected light state   ", classified_state)
	ROSpy.logwarn("car_wp_idx: " + str(car_wp_idx) + " stop line position idx: " + str(line_wp_idx))
return line_wp_idx, classified_state
```

### 5. TLClassifier object

The `TLClassifier' class in `tl_classifier.py` offers the method `get_classification` that calls TensorFlow to run the inference for a single image with the method `run_inference_for_single_image`.

```python
def get_classification(self, image):
	image_np = self.load_image_into_numpy_array(image)
	output_dict = self.run_inference_for_single_image(image_np, self.detection_graph)
	text_string = "Classified light state : {0} with probability {1}"
	if (output_dict['detection_scores'][0] > 0.5):
		text_string += " > 0.5"
	else:
		text_string += " <= 0.5"
	ROSpy.logwarn(text_string.format(output_dict['detection_classes'][0],output_dict['detection_scores'][0]))
	if (output_dict['detection_scores'][0] > 0.5):
		if (output_dict['detection_classes'][0] == 3 ):
			return TrafficLight.GREEN
		if (output_dict['detection_classes'][0] == 2 ):
			return TrafficLight.YELLOW
		if (output_dict['detection_classes'][0] == 1 ):
			return TrafficLight.RED
	return TrafficLight.UNKNOWN
```

```python
def run_inference_for_single_image(self,image, graph):
	with graph.as_default():
		with tf.Session() as sess:
			ops = tf.get_default_graph().get_operations()
			all_tensor_names = {output.name for op in ops for output in op.outputs}
			tensor_dict = {}
			for key in ['num_detections', 'detection_boxes', 'detection_scores', 'detection_classes', 'detection_masks']:
				tensor_name = key + ':0'
				if tensor_name in all_tensor_names:
					tensor_dict[key] = tf.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name(tensor_name)
			image_tensor = tf.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name('image_tensor:0')
			output_dict = sess.run(tensor_dict, feed_dict={image_tensor: np.expand_dims(image, 0)})
			output_dict['num_detections'] = int(output_dict['num_detections'][0])
			output_dict['detection_classes'] = output_dict['detection_classes'][0].astype(np.uint8)
			output_dict['detection_boxes'] = output_dict['detection_boxes'][0]
			output_dict['detection_scores'] = output_dict['detection_scores'][0]
	return output_dict
```

## 3. Traffic light detection

We used TensorFlow Object Detection API and fine-tuned with traffic lights data a pre-trained SSD MobileNet on the COCO Dataset. The model is able to detect traffic lights and classify their color into Green, Yellow and Red. 

In the first iteration of this project, we combined three datasets which combined a mix of images from the simulator and from Carla testing site. The combination of these three datasets adds up to a total of 2,613 images. The results of the model sufficiently met our needs, achieving a good balance between accuracy and fast running time.

The [description](./Traffic_Light_Detection/README.md) of the traffic light detection model is located in a separate [folder](./Traffic_Light_Detection/).




## 4. Execution

### 1. Commands to start the simulation

```console
<make sure you are in the ros subdirectory of this repository>
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```

Start the Udacity Simulator after the Udacity Carla ROS environment of this project is waiting. Then check `Camera` and uncheck `Manual`. The car will follow the center of the lane at the desired speed and stop at the stop line of upcoming traffic lights if the traffic light state is `RED` or `YELLOW`.

### 2. Simulation results

Here is an example of how the car accelerates and stops as required all by itself. On the right you see the debugging information.

<img src="docu_images/190303_StAn_Udacity_Simulator_Run_01_small.gif" width="100%">

### 3. Commands to test the code in the real environment

Download the [training bag](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic_light_bag_file.zip) that was recorded on the Udacity Carla vehicle. Extract the content and run the ROS bag.

```console
unzip traffic_light_bag_file.zip
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_file/traffic_light_training.bag
```

Open another terminal and start the Udacity Carla ROS environment of this project with the `site.launch` file.

```console
<make sure you are in the ros subdirectory of this repository>
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```

And then ?!?

### 4. Test results

No results yet

## 5. Discussion

The major issue in this project is to set up a pipeline of hardware and software that fulfills the needs and is compatible with the setup in the Udacity Carla vehicle.

## 6. Known issues and possible improvements

As the provided stop line coordinates for the traffic lights are not exact and additional inaccuracy is added by selecting a waypoint close to them, the vehicle sometimes overshoots the stop line.
